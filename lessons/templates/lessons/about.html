            <p> 
                Django Lessons is a weekly screencast about <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django Web Framework</a>
                and related ecosystem. The screencasts are short and focus on one technique so you can quickly move on to applying it to your own project. The topics target the intermediate Django developer, but beginners and experts will get something out of it as well.
