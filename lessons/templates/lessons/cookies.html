            <h2>What Are Cookies</h2>

            <p>
                As is common practice with almost all professional websites
                this site uses cookies, which are tiny files that are
                downloaded to your computer, to improve your experience. This
                page describes what information they gather, how we use it and
                why we sometimes need to store these cookies. We will also
                share how you can prevent these cookies from being stored
                however this may downgrade or 'break' certain elements of the
                sites functionality.
                For more general information on cookies see the Wikipedia
                article on HTTP Cookies.

            <p>
                We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below.
                Unfortunately in most cases there are no industry standard options
                for disabling cookies without completely disabling the
                functionality and features they add to this site. It is
                recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure
                whether you need them or not in case they are used to provide a
                service that you use.
            </p>

            <h2>Disabling Cookies</h2>

            <p>
                You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings
                on your browser (see your browser Help for how to do this). Be
                aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this
                and many other websites that you visit. Disabling cookies will
                usually result in also disabling certain functionality and
                features of the this site. Therefore it is recommended that you do
                not disable cookies.
