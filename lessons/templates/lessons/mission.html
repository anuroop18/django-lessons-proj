            <p>
                If you try hard and fail to understand some concept, it
                is not because concept is too difficult for you, it is just
                that the idea is poorly presented.

                Despite great amount of documentation it is more and more
                difficult task to track  ever increasing amount of techology
                information. Some projects are better documented, some are
                poorly documented, part of documentation is outdated, part of
                it is just too much to read.

            <h4>For Mid-Level Developers</h4>
            <p>
                After you skimmed Django documentation, watched a couple of YouTube videos, completed a few simple projects, maybe you even landed in couple of python jobs - it starts to be more and more challenging to improve your skills. You will realize (like me) that there are less and less resources for intermediate developers. Django Lessons fills in this gap. It targets intermediate software developers who want to improve their skills about Django, Python, Web and cloud software in general.

                To some extend it might be useful to beginners and well.
