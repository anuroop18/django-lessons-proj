            <p>
                If you try hard and fail to don't understand some concept, it
                is not because concept is too difficult for you, it is just
                that the idea is poorly presented.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Despite great amount of documentation it is more and more
                difficult task to track  ever increasing amount of techology
                information. Some projects are better documented, some are
                poorly documented, part of documentation is outdated, part of
                it is just too much to read.
            </p>
