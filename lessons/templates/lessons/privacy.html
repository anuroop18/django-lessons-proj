                browser when you interact with the Services, including your IP
                address and cookie information. This information is used for
                fighting spam/malware and also to facilitate collection of

                a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would identify
                you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us and
                third parties authorized by us to figure out how often
                individuals use parts of the Services so that we can analyze
                and improve them.
