Django Lessons
===============

Web App for hosting video lessons. It hosts
[django-lessons.com](https://django-lessons.com) which is a series of short and
to the point django related tutorials targeted for intermediate developers.

In past I worked with RubyOnRails web framework and I was a huge fan of
[Railscasts](http://railscasts.com). I want to create something similar for
Django Community.
